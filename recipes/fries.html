    <p>french fries, side dish or snack typically made from deep-fried potatoes that have been cut into various shapes, especially thin strips. Fries are often salted and served with other items, including ketchup, mayonnaise, or vinegar.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teasoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown. </li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon. </li>
        <li> Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time. </li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate. </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
